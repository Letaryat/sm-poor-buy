# sm-poor-buy
Sourcemod plugin for CSGO Legacy that allows you to buy weapons that are unavailable via commands such as:
- M4A1s (Only for CT) - !m4a1s,
- CZ75a - !cz75a
- Revolver - !r8

Plugin itself is a modifed version of [Weapon Giver](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=1803461) + a little bit of chatgpt.
It probably isn't the best but it works as intended.
